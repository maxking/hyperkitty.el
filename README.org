[[https://melpa.org/#/hyperkitty][file:https://melpa.org/packages/hyperkitty-badge.svg]]

An emacs package for reading public mailing list archives hosted via
[[https://hyperkitty.readthedocs.io][Hyperkitty]].

Currently, this is a WIP and can only fetch and list emails in a new buffer.

* Usage

In order to use this, you can install it from [[https://melpa.org/#/hyperkitty][Melpa]]:

#+begin_src
M-x package-install RET hyperkitty
#+end_src

If you aren't using MELPA repository already, you can do so by adding the
following to your Emacs's init file:

#+begin_src elisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+end_src

After that, add this to your emacs init file to choose MailingLists:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'hyperkitty)
(setq hyperkitty-mlists
      (list
       (cons "test@mailman3.org" "https://lists.mailman3.org/archives")))
#+end_src

Then, you need to only start using by running ~M-x hyperkitty~.
